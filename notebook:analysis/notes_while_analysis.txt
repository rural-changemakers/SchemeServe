notes about dataset:

Response ID - 5b2f0cba-3a36-4b14-863a-e5a15bc8f20e has member name as '854229143883' instead of an actual name

Apparently no SC in the database

major illness stub may require manual work

Made a judgement call regarding age ranges, it's inclusive i.e >60 includes age 60 and <1 includes age 1

household_primary_source_income will need a manual look

Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojna criteria not clear
